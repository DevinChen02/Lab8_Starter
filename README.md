# "Check Your Understanding" questions: 

1) Option 1. The automated tests are fit within a Github actions that runs whenever code is pushed. Because in automation testing, the scripts are written to automatically test your new and existing software based on events like code getting pushed to the remote repository. 

<br>

2) No.

<br>

3) No, I would not. Because the "message" feature needs to test the process of writing and sending message to another user, but unit testing cannot test how the individual components interact with each other on a feature or application level.

<br>

4) Yes, I would. Because the "max message length" feature is a small scale feature without many moving parts, and we just want to test whether the feature could prevent the user from typing morn than 80 characters.
